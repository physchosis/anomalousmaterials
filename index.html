      <h2>Author or Got Materials?</h2>
      <p>Maybe you have a blog today, a whitepaper, an awesome new code repository, or found some awesome new security or hacking thing that you want to share. How about helping to create some material artifacts or help create some guides on how to do things.
      The goal of this project is to develop a way of sharing security/hacking informational materials and artifacts in a new way. 
There is also a simple collaborative app where people can submit new materials, attack and defend guides and articles across the Security Community. Notice I didn't use the word Cyber? Its because a printed 3D Key of a TSA lock...Is not Cyber related....
So whether you have a new project that sends out AM frequencies on a system bus, a new 3D printed project for creating keys, an awesome article, guide, or tutorial, or a new project that defends against attacks the goal is to provide a way of sharing this information, in a somewhat distributed way. 
</p>
      <p>To create anomalous materials, you have a few options. <br>
      <h4>Option 1</h4>
      <P><a href="./app/entry.html">Login</a> and click the create/submit link in the nav. You will then be presented with a simple form, and you can also read more about advanced options.<br><a class="btn btn-success" href="./app/entry.html">Login Now</a></P>
      <h4>Option 2</h4>
      <p>Fork/Clone amp-materials repo, add anomalous metadata file, submit pull request. </p>
      <h4>Option 3</h4>
      <p>For users that want to host their own anomalous metadata file either in their own repo or elsewhere. If you are using github, you can simply create a new repo, or add the metadata file to an existing repo and then submit it using the create/submit form under anomalout/advanced to submit the URL of the anomalous material metadata file. 
      If you are not using github, and you are hosting the metadata file on a server with CORS enabled, then you must provide access for the anomalous materials domain. This is only temporary as there is currently no server backend to process outbound requests. In the future I may add other methods to submit depending on your feedback. For information on CORS see the wikipedia article or determine how to add the appropriate cross origin resource headers for your specific environment.
      </p>

      <h4>Do you find it difficult to keep track of new material in the security market?</h4>
      <p>By material, we don't just mean content, we mean any material. Maybe there is a new way to attack something, or defend it. Maybe a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio/tree/master/In%20Javascript">new project or code that someone started on github was just released</a>, a steganographic audio file with an embedded CyberSpace Token Ring that wins you free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper" target="_blank">Captain Crunch</a>... or <a href="https://blindseeker.com/blahg/?p=817" target="_blank">guides on how to</a> do ____ on ____ using ____. <br><br>Sure there is google, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pintrest.com">bookmarketing tools</a>, awesome youtube video channels, conferences, books, twitterverse, IRC, and major news portals so why would I need something else? 
      The problem for me at least was finding, quality material without diving into a pile of _______ and filtering through the noise. Sometimes, I would sit watching the twittersphere, asking people, or hunting for information. Then one day I spoke to an archeologist, and my anomalous light went off...Why not treat materials in our market, as artifacts....because if its known...its probably no longer an 0 day...

      <h4>Swimming in a _____ pool of meaningless jargon, hype, and buzzwords</h4>
      <p>Everywhere we look, there seems to be some new thing that exploits a somewhat older thing, then the older thing is patched/fixed/removed. A few days,weeks,years later a magical product is created/offered that will fix everything and supposedly clean your ____ while its at it. All while it ends up getting promoted by _______. While the noise is useful to the market from a business perspective, raising public awareness, or increasing one's ego, there is a downside. That noise, is sometimes so ___ loud, that the quality information, the subtle notes by artists on how something actually works, how you can learn from it...utilize it...or do something about it...sink to the bottom, forgotten, only to be seen floating to the surface again, as time goes by.   
      But since everyone is in the market of making up terms.....<br><strong>The Anomalous Project</strong> will go ahead and assist in the process....
      <br><br>Uh so WTF is this thing and the goal again?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvODpHnV9o4" target="_blank">da da daaa magical strings play</a>....The goal of this project is to hopefully provide <strong>You The Anomalous Reader</strong> with access to material like Guides, Rants and Raves, and material artifacts similar to keeping a stack of old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2600-The-Hacker-Digest-Volume-ebook/dp/B007Q1EBIS" target="_blank">2600 magazines</a> from back in the day. There is a big twist though. The material themselves will have Linked Metadata information that will enable the app and others to hopefully produce some really cool customizations just for  <strong>You The Anomalous Reader</strong>.

Im currently still working on the coding process for gathering and displaying materials is being toyed around with and contemplated.<br> <br>This is why I need <strong>You The Anomalous Reader's</strong> help.  <br>First by <a href="https://github.com/physchosis/anomalousmaterials/issues" target="_blank"> opening issues with the following</a> and by offering any other help if you can.  Even a nifty logo would help...<br>

      --List of code projects, haks, either new or old, but not being media hyped.<br>

      <h4>Get to the point! What is the app like???</h4>
      <p><strong>Initially</strong> the material will be provided visually in a small app in a 
      card format kind of like bookmarketing websites or seen below. The difference is in how the cards 
      linking to the material are constructed. Basically each anomalous material, will use metadata maintained by
      either the author...or the creator (the person that found it).... At which point each card will have associated 
      options on what you can do with the anomalous material. Maybe you can downloaded it...maybe its encrypted..maybe the 
      material itself is secret code for the user cyber apocalpyse end of the world date...or a puzzle produced by 1o57 
      for you to solve...For instance if its an artifact that is a video, then it might play the video, if it is an artifact 
      to a code repository, it might show you information regarding the project, possibly snippets of code etc. The metadata 
      may also be linked thus making a material artifact a larger conglomerate.
      <br><br>
      Unlike the bookmarketing sites, the idea behind a conglomerate is to group related anomalous materials together. <strong>The following is a good history lesson</strong> to give you a better idea. 
      Back in the mid-late 90's there was a digital Artist group called <a href="http://www.ICE.org" target="_new">ICE.org</a> one of the really cool things they did was make something called Artist <a href="http://www.ice.org/tiles/Mainquilters-32:-Time" target="_blank">Digital Tiles</a>. The digital tiles were a collaboration of artwork combined into one big image. Think of google maps, but that each title consists of someone actually creating the artwork behind the tile. Rumor has it that some of the artist were big in the demoscene, and cracktros back in the day...
