#The Anomalous Materials Project
>Exceptional things come from abnormal, atypical, irregular, aberrant, freakish, odd, bizarre, peculiar, unusual, and out of the ordinary HUMANS!


#What is it?

>The goal of this project is to develop a simple collaborative app where people can submit new attack and defend guides and articles across the Security Community. Notice I didn't use the word Cyber? Its because a printed 3D Key of a TSA lock...Is not Cyber related....

#Dumbass....this already exists.

>Sure there are thousands of blogs, content management systems, apps, major news outlets, youtube, and daily emails or tools that someone could use to bookmark everything, but wouldn't it be great if we had a repo of all of this wonderful knowledge wrapped up with a nice bow on it?

#Status

>This project is just getting started and may not go anywhere. Help would be much appreciated.
